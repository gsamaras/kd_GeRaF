# kd-GeRaF
*kd-GeRaF* is a **C++ [header-only](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only) library**, whcich provides a Generalized Randomized k-d Forest for (approximate) Nearest Neighbor Search in a high dimensional space.


## How to use kd-GeRaF?

Just include kd-GeRaF's header file.

## How fast is kd-GeRaF??

We handle GIST datasets of 10<sup>6</sup> images in 960 dimensions in < 1 sec with about 90% outputs being true nearest neighbors.
